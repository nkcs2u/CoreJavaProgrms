    static block:
        . static key word & {} can be used.
        . when jvm loads class , static block runs before main() method.
        . can have n  number pf static blocks
        . static blocks will execute in same sequence as source code

    how to run java class without creating object:
        . static block and main method which has no dependency on instance, can be called.

    static block vs static method:
        . static block called automatically, method shall be called with class name.
        . static method can be used by other method called cpver method

    constructor is private:
        . have static block to create the object for private constructor

    without  creating main() method:
        . static block will be called

    initialize static variables in static block


   static final variable does noot require static block to run.
