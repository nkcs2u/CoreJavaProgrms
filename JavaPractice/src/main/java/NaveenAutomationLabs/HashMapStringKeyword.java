    why string popular hash key

    create class Employee (name , code int)

    create EmpMap (Employee , String>

    create emp object, add to EmpMap

    Hashmap -> store technique
    key is Employee mutable class
    hashcode calculated on emp object & string value

    now if u change the object property (any attribute)
    this will cause, map.get(key) will fail.
    problem with mutable object

    better use wrapper class or immutable only
    cache will have the mapping of immutable key & hashcode
