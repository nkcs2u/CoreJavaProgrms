    Main method can be overloaded
    public static void main(String[] args)
    method overloading:
        same name, different types of params, different number of params

    you can have:
    main(int a , int b)
    main(int a)

    But, jvm calls only main(String[] args) & which is public, void, static
    you can call other main() methods in the above. similar to static/instance methods.
    you can call main(String[] args) from other class
    A.main("10")
