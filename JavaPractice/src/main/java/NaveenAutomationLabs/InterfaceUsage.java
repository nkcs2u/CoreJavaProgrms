    . it ll have only method declarations, usually.
    . implementation in another class
    . can have final, static
    . cannot have non-static or cannot have instance variable

    . implementing class can have non overriding methods also
    . dynamic polymorphism is psossible / upcasting
    . if child specific methods are there, then its not accessible in upcasting
    . abstract classes performance is good , interface is slow
